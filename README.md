# CPSC 304 Project (Bryan, Maziyar, William)

## Project Description
Our project models a municipal system keeping track of reported physical incidents in a city. Our database
aims to keep track of many aspects of an incident, including its location, the people involved, and the
equipment/vehicles necessary to respond to the case.

## Timeline
- Oct 31: Finish Milestone 3 timeline (Bryan, Maz, William), hand in Milestone 3
- Nov 3: Meet with TA about Milestone 3 (Bryan, Maz, William) 11:20-11:35
- Weekly meetings Nov 5 - Nov 26 Sunday 10am
- Nov 23: Sign up for Milestone 5 Demo (Bryan, Maz, William)
- Nov 24: Finish portions of milestone 4
    - SQL queries for Oracle (Bryan)
    - Backend using JavaScript (William)
    - Frontend webapp in JavaScript (Maz)
- Nov 26: Implementation is finished, combine parts + debug (Bryan, Maz, William)
- Dec 1: Milestone 4 is due, check it's handed in (Bryan, Maz, William)
    - One SQL file (Bryan)
    - Finish PDF (Maz, William)
- Dec 1: Complete group peer evaluation Milestone 6 individually (Bryan, Maz, William)
- Dec 3: Meet up to practice demo contents (Bryan, Maz, William), hand in any other deliverables
- Dec 4-7: Complete Milestone 5 demo (Bryan, Maziyar, William)

## Challenges
- Communication on tasks
- Active collaboration
- Finding a date to combine all portions together
- Linking the portions together (the endpoints the frontend will use with the backend, having an interface
  to execute SQL queries)
  - In weekly meetings, discuss and agree on the endpoints
- Finding the proper resources to accomplish the tasks (e.g. tutorials)
  - Ask TA if stuck on finding resources ASAP
