# CPSC 304 Project (Bryan, Maziyar, William)

## Project Description
Our project models a municipal system keeping track of reported physical incidents in a city. Our database
aims to keep track of many aspects of an incident, including its location, the people involved, and the
equipment/vehicles necessary to respond to the case.
